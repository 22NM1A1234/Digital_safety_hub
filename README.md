In the current digital era, individuals are disproportionately impacted by cyberthreats including phishing, identity theft, and online abuse, especially in areas with low cybersecurity resources and knowledge. The dearth of easily available, user-friendly platforms that meet their unique needs makes it difficult for many people to report these instances. Additionally, underreporting and extended exposure to cyber threats are caused by the fact that current reporting procedures frequently lack the support and direction they require. The need for a specialized platform that enables individuals to securely and efficiently report cybersecurity issues is highlighted by this gap, which will promote a more secure online environment for everyone. We are now working on creating a real-time website where users may report problems, verify the URL, get chatbot support, access resources, and manage report updates.
